#Kahnâ€™s Algorithm for Topological Sorting is a method used to order the vertices of a directed graph 
# in a linear order such that for every directed edge from vertex A to vertex B, A comes before B in the order. 
# The algorithm works by repeatedly finding vertices with no incoming edges, removing them from the graph, 
# and updating the incoming edges of the remaining vertices. This process continues until all vertices have been ordered.

#In order to perform Kahn's algorithm you need an adjacency list of the incoming edges for each node.
#If only given the outgoing edges, you can recreate this, and count the indegree's in the same loop.
